The Movie table has the following columns:

    ID—integer, primary key
    Title—variable-length string
    Genre—variable-length string
    RatingCode—variable-length string
    Year—integer

The YearStats table has the following columns:

    Year—integer
    TotalGross—bigint unsigned
    Releases—integer

Write a SQL query to display both the Title and the TotalGross (if available) for all movies. Ensure 
your result set returns the columns in the order indicated.

-- Your SQL goes here
SELECT M.Title, Y.TotalGross
FROM Movie AS M
LEFT JOIN YearStats AS Y ON M.Year = Y.Year; --Apparently doesn't need to be primary/foreign keys
