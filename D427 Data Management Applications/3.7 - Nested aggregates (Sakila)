Refer to the film and inventory tables of the Sakila database. The tables in this lab have the same columns and data types but fewer rows.

Write a query that lists the titles of films with the fewest rows in the inventory table.

This query requires a subquery that computes the minimum of counts by film_id:

        SELECT MIN(count_film_id) 
        FROM ( SELECT COUNT(film_id) AS count_film_id
            FROM inventory
            GROUP BY film_id ) 
        AS temp_table;

This subquery is provided in the template.

-- Your SELECT statement goes here
SELECT f.title
FROM film f
INNER JOIN inventory i ON i.film_id = f.film_id
GROUP BY f.title
HAVING COUNT(i.film_id ) =                              -- Cannot use aggregates with WHERE
  ( SELECT MIN(count_film_id) FROM 
      ( SELECT COUNT(film_id) AS count_film_id
        FROM inventory
        GROUP BY film_id ) 
    AS temp_table );
